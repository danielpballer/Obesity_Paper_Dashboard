264,May 27 2020 06:53 PM,"People make the choice to eat & overeat. The failure of healthcare professionals to give proper guidance & parents failure to give children home cooked meals, allowing kids to drink sodas, eat junk food, fast food, candy, and failure to make kids exercise is a signatory cause. Both of my parents worked full time. But we had meals at home, no junk food, no desserts, no soda except for special occasions. In the 1960s & 70s there was usually only one fat mid in the class. Frankly, I blame political correctness for problems. Doctors, schools, public health officials worry about fat / body shaming instead of telling obese people to get healthy. I’ve been overweight. I’ve had bulimia & anorexia. But I blame nobody. The key is to eat less & exercise more. My brother was told he had to lose 60 pounds before he could undergo surgery for a knee replacement. He changed his diet & lost 70 pounds. Very few obese people have thyroid excuses. ",68
